    "Hey https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1208799271721028, the original task asked me to recycle material from an existing brochure, not a website, so that was what I did. Website wasn't mentioned anywhere that I noticed, but maybe I missed something? There was also a heavy time constraint on it (2 flyers, 30 minutes), so I pressed on with it with that in mind. This is a partial of Ellie's note: Please dont spend a lot of time on this! Maybe about 30 min ? Scoping convo on slack: https://halsteadmedia.slack.com/archives/C07DSHJ2GRW/p1741716339289289\nFor each of these flyers,  recycle copy from this brochure and add CTAs: \n https://docs.google.com/document/d/18fagJf_JND2ChlswbW2zoex5zI1MfY_RNIG_2EZKRM8/edit?usp=sharing",

I'm hoping that you can help with a quick update to all of the landscape design service pages!\n\nWe're wanting to add a small section at the very bottom of the page with links to the previous & next services. \n\nHere's a google doc with the step-by-step instructions and a video walkthrough!!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/10zwQUP21tq0tXoi6WGUDWLHATvd-IlkWgwg5WZ8Cq2M/edit?usp=sharing\n\nLet me know if you have any questions while you're going through it - thank you so much! \ud83d\ude4c",

    "Hi https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1209264874946823!! Jut a few revisions from Dani on the service pages you built out!! Nothing major, just a few little spacing & copy things! \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNf15TyFgWau6MXH58SiwA7dBq7p4gk6TL04EWCk0EE/edit?tab=t.0\n\nFrom now on I'm going to get the designer who is working on the site to build out instructions for you because I think that some of the little things just got lost when I was creating the instructions! So I apologize for that! \n\nLet me know if you have any questions at all!",
    "https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1205337487077774- \n\n1.5 Hours - and I noticed some other little things that needed to be done (the wrong color for the first sentence of testimonials), etc. Did those too.",
    "https://app.asana.com/0/0/1209181717376201/f\n\nHi https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1206729612623556! These edits have been made, and I've attached the brochure files below. \n\nI'm not sure if you're getting a proof done before the full print, but can you please ask the printer to triple check that the print file is set up properly and confirm that there won't be any formatting issues? Print jobs always make me nervous lol, so I want to be 100% sure that the file is ok and meets all the requirements. Thanks!",
    "https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1205337487077774 can you remove the tagline on the last page \u201cExpert Landscaping Rooted in Northeast Wisconsin\u201d - then we will be moving to a hard proof so I'll double check with the printer that everything looks good!",
    "https://app.asana.com/0/0/1209118373371883/f\n\nHi https://app.asana.com/0/profile/1206729612623556 - here's the updated brochure in spread & single page previews. Let me know if you need me to make any more updates! \n\nNote: These are NOT print ready files, I can send those over once the design is approved.",
